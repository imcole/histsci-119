        <h1>From Beneficence to "Needs, Self-Interest, and Subordination": The Gap Between Montagnais-Naskapi Beaver Hunting and European Depictions</h1>

        <p> The scientific practice of the hunting of beavers and other Eastern Canadian furbearers, as shown by observations of the Montagnais-Naskapi people of Northern Québec-Labrador, was a complex process that required both spiritual rituals and strong ecological knowledge. However, historical accounts of North American fur trading display a wide array of European ethnological approaches to aboriginal fur hunters and traders. This story map traces the reasons behind these discrepancies. In particular, the introduction of commercial trading-with its incentives of sovereign grants, military power, and financial gains from trade-served as a catalyst for concealing and transforming the true nature of beaver hunting in European depictions. 


        <p> This background for this storymap, entitled “Carte geographique de la Nouvelle Franse,” was drawn in 1613 by one of the biggest actors in France’s entry into the North American fur trade: Samuel de Champlain. Throughout his forays into exploration and trade between 1603 and 1629 in the St. Lawrence River Valley, de Champlain mapped the locations of various groups of aboriginal people, including the Montagnais. The map includes both a geographic depiction of the St. Lawrence River Valley area and artistic depictions of ecological symbols and aboriginal people. These depictions are subjective, and demonstrate the European colonization mentality of their author.

        <p> During the completion of this project, I used the Cabonalyser plug-in on Firefox to monitor carbon emissions and track the breakdown of my output. A screenshot of the results can be seen to the right. Despite the high emissions it shows, I actually had to switch to Chrome due to internet issues with the storymap.js website halfway through; so the real result would be even higher.


        <p> For the emissions it tracked, 4332 minutes of browsing, I used 787 gCO2e, equivalent to driving 3.577 kms by car. This metric is a sobering detail for the use of technology in academia, something that typically carries a stereotype of being more ethical than textbooks and printed papers.
